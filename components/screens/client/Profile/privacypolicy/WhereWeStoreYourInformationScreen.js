          Where Personal Data is transferred outside the territorial
          jurisdiction of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, including to
          countries that may not provide an equivalent level of data protection,
          such transfers shall be carried out in accordance with applicable
          laws, including the Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA) 2023 and, where
          relevant, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To ensure the
          continued protection of your Personal Data, we implement appropriate
          safeguards, which may include: Data Processing Agreements (DPAs):
          Contractual arrangements with third-party processors to ensure
          compliance with privacy obligations. Standard Contractual Clauses
          (SCCs): Adopted or approved clauses that guarantee adequate protection
          and enforcement of data subject rights in jurisdictions outside
          Nigeria. International Compliance Mechanisms: Where applicable, we may
          rely on adequacy decisions or certifications recognized under the GDPR
          or similar frameworks. All transfers are executed under strict legal
          and technical controls to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and
          availability of your Personal Data.
